Package: python3-physical
Architecture: all
Depends: ${python3:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Library of units with dimensional analysis in various languages
 This purpose of this package is to easy and consistent access to an extensive
 set of physical units, constants, unit systems, and conversion of physical
 quantities between various arbitrary unit systems.  While this package began
 with the crude support of the C++/C languages only, it now includes a
 sophisticated interface for the C++ and Python languages that allows for
 parsing of complex mathematical expressions with strict runtime dimensional
 analysis.  Also included are new rudimentary interfaces for the Octave/Matlab
 language as well as for Gnuplot.
 .
 This package provides the Python3 interface.
